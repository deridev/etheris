            Today George told me something about the planet Etheris, he told me that one day mankind will create amazing things like horseless wagons! He likes to imagine impossible things.
            In the evening George showed me a cave he had found north of my house, there was a shiny crystal there and George told me that this was the crystal that taught him how to speak! He said it was called the Intelligence Crystal.
            I brought the crystal home without George because I was curious about it, and my parents let George sleep in the house tonight!

            I went to the cave to see if there were any more crystals, I got lost in there but I found a chest with lots of crystals in it! I quickly ate them all, and quickly found my way out of the cave.
            I was feeling different, it was as if strange things and images were going through my mind. I saw confusing things like iron wagons with wheels, giant flying metallic birds. It was very strange, until now I don't know what's happening to me.
            I guess I shouldn't have eaten the crystal.

            Its unnerving visage bears completely white, elongated eyes that seem to penetrate the very soul of any onlooker. 
            Remarkably, the entity lacks both nose and mouth, with a skull proportioned at 2.3 times larger than that of an average human.
        
            Its sinewy arms extend to unnaturally elongated proportions, terminating in a mere triad of elongated fingers adorned with menacing 15-centimeter claws. 
            Interestingly, its lower extremities are reminiscent of equine anatomy, featuring legs that curve with a grace akin to those of a horse. 
            The feet mirror the hands in structure but boast a lengthier build."#,

            While typically docile, ENTITY-039 displays an unprecedented ferocity towards any life form within a 5-meter radius. 
            It accelerates to a staggering speed of 128 km/h, swiftly reducing any approaching entity to its elemental components. 
            Regrettably, ENTITY-039 has been the catalyst for the untimely demise of ~~6~~ 21 researchers to date.
        
            Devoid of vocalization or attempts at escape, the entity exhibits no discernible requirements for sustenance, eschewing both food and water. 
            Curiously, it harbors an inexplicable dread solely towards rabbits. In the presence of these small creatures, ENTITY-039 portrays a distinct sense of fear, invariably retreating at the sight of a rabbit, refraining from aggression and displaying palpable signs of trepidation."#,
