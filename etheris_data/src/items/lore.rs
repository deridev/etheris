            Its sinewy arms extend to unnaturally elongated proportions, terminating in a mere triad of elongated fingers adorned with menacing 15-centimeter claws. 
            Interestingly, its lower extremities are reminiscent of equine anatomy, featuring legs that curve with a grace akin to those of a horse.

            While typically docile, ENTITY-039 displays an unprecedented ferocity towards any life form within a 5-meter radius. 
            It accelerates to a staggering speed of 128 km/h, swiftly reducing any approaching entity to its elemental components.

            Devoid of vocalization or attempts at escape, the entity exhibits no discernible requirements for sustenance, eschewing both food and water. 
            Curiously, it harbors an inexplicable dread solely towards rabbits. In the presence of these small creatures, ENTITY-039 portrays a distinct sense of fear, invariably retreating at the sight of a rabbit, refraining from aggression and displaying palpable signs of trepidation."#,

            The entity's coloration fluctuates between sickly pale hues and deep, bruise-like purples.

            Despite its chaotic form, ENTITY-104 demonstrates an unnerving level of awareness. 
            Countless eyes, of various sizes and colors, open and close across its surface, ceaselessly observing its surroundings. 
            The mouths occasionally emit barely audible whispers in unknown or random languages.
            
            When agitated, ENTITY-104 extrudes bone-like protrusions that resemble mangled human limbs, only to reabsorb them moments later.

            This process is excruciatingly painful for the victim, whose consciousness appears to persist within ENTITY-104 for an short but random period, ranging from a few minutes to the maximum of three hours.

            The entity communicates through a form of telepathic broadcast that induces vivid, terrifying hallucinations in nearby sentient beings. 
            These hallucinations often feature loved ones in states of extreme distress or the observers themselves experiencing gruesome deaths. 
            Prolonged exposure has led to cases of insanity and self-harm among research staff.

            ENTITY-104 exhibits a disturbing affinity for human blood. Exposure to blood triggers rapid growth and increased activity. 
            During these growth phases, partially formed human faces have been observed to emerge from its mass, screaming silently before being reabsorbed.

            Perhaps most disturbingly, ENTITY-104 can temporarily assume the form of recently assimilated individuals, mimicking their appearance and mannerisms with unsettling accuracy.

            Current containment protocols involve a hermetically sealed chamber surrounded by a vacuum, with all interactions conducted via robotic proxies.

            Direct interaction with ENTITY-104 is strictly forbidden following the loss of â–ˆâ–ˆ research team members to assimilation. 
            Those exposed to the entity for even short periods report persistent nightmares, paranoia, and a compulsion to return to it. 
            In â–ˆâ–ˆ cases, staff members have attempted to breach containment to reach the entity, necessitating termination.

            ENTITY-104 demonstrates an aversion to certain frequencies of infrasound, which appear to cause it pain. 
            However, prolonged exposure to these frequencies has resulted in rapid, unpredictable mutations, including the development of rudimentary auditory organs across its surface.

            The origin of ENTITY-104 remains unknown, though recovered documents suggest links to â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ's experiments in â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.
